[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) plugin for integration with [Waffle](https://getwaffle.io/).

## What

You can use this plugin to build smart contract tests using Waffle in Hardhat, taking advantage of both.

This plugin adds a Hardhat-ready version of Waffle to the Hardhat Runtime Environment, and automatically initializes the Waffle Chai matchers.
