Plugins are the backbone of Hardhat, and they're built using the same config DSL that you use in your Hardhat configuration. Read the [Building plugins](https://hardhat.org/advanced/building-plugins.html) guide to learn how to create your own, and [send a pull request](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/plugins.js) to get it listed here.

Extend Hardhat's functionality with the plugins below.
